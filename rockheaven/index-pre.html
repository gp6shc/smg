              <p>John Lennon (Oct. 9, 1940 – Dec. 8, 1980) Lennon formed half of music’s most successful songwriting partnership, joining with Paul McCartney to compose dozens of Number 1 hits. Lennon founded The Quarrymen in the late 1950s in his hometown of Liverpool, England, eventually joined in the band by McCartney and guitarist George Harrison. Lennon change the group’s name to The Beatles and, finally joined by drummer Ringo Starr, in 1962 the band began an eight-year run producing an unprecedented string of hit singles and such influential albums as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles (White Album) and Abbey Road. After the band broke up in 1970, Lennon went on to have a successful solo career with hits like “Instant Karma,” “Imagine,” “Mind Games,” “Whatever Gets You Through the Night” and “(Just Like) Starting Over.” After a five-year break from recording to concentrate on raising his young son, Lennon made a successful return to the music scene in 1980. Shortly after the release of the album Double Fantasy, at the age of 40, Lennon was shot to death when he arrived home from a recording session. Lennon was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994. </p>

              <p>Elvis Presley (Jan. 8, 1935 – Aug. 16, 1978) Universally hailed as the King of Rock and Roll, Presley exploded onto the music scene in the mid 1950s. Presley was a truck driver when he was discovered in 1953 by producer Sam Phillips. He came into Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee, to record a song for his mother, and Philips was struck by Presley’s voice and signed the singer. Inspired by gospel, country and western, and rhythm and blues, Presley and his band (guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black) recorded a number of songs for Sun, including “That’s Alright, Mama” and “Blue Moon of Kentucky.” Presley signed with RCA in 1955 and subsequently released a succession of hit records, including “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Hound Dog,” “Jailhouse Rock” and the title track from his first movie, “Love Me Tender.” Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958 and after two year in the service he returned and focused primarily on making movies and recording soundtracks. Presley starred in 33 movies in his career and returned to making music in 1968 with his famed televised comeback special. That was followed with music he recorded in Memphis, including “Suspicious Minds,” “In the Ghetto” and “Kentucky Rain.” Presley was 42 years old when he died of a heart attack at Graceland, his Memphis mansion, on August 16, 1977. He continues to hold the record for most Top 40 hits (104), most Top 10 hits (38) and most weeks at Number One (80). Presley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. </p>

His first album, Are You Experienced, featured songs that would come to define a generation, including “Purple Haze,” “The Wind Cries Mary” and “Foxey Lady.” The left-handed guitarist built his own recording studio, Electric Lady Studios, in the late 1960s, and closed the legendary Woodstock Music and Art Festival in August 1969.

              <p>Jim Morrison (December 8, 1943 – July 3, 1971)  Charismatic lead singer and lyricist for The Doors, Morrison and keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Kregier and drummer John Densmore exploded onto the national music scene in the mid 1960s with their hit song “Light My Fire.”  After being thrown off of the Ed Sullivan Show for singing the song’s line "girl, we couldn't get much higher," The Doors created some of the most poetic, intense and revolutionary rock 'n' roll music ever produced. At 11 minutes, the band's song, "The End" was one of rock's first long-form pieces and exemplifies the sound of mid-60s "acid rock." Backed by Manzarek's calliope style of organ playing, Morrison wrote  image-rich lyrics that revolutionized the rock genre. The band ventured across musical styles, with hits ranging from the blues-infused "Roadhouse Blues" to the horn-rich pop song "Touch Me" to the ethereal "Riders on the Storm." Morrison frequently clashed with authorities, including memorable incidents in which he was banned from the Ed Sullivan Show after ignoring demands to change certain lyrics  and his controversial arrest in Miami for alleged indecent behavior. He died in the bathtub of a Paris apartment at the age of 27 and is buried a short distance away. Morrison was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Doors in 1993.</p>

              <p>Keith Moon (Aug. 23, 1946 – Sept. 7, 1978) One of the greatest rock and roll drummers ever, Moon earned a reputation as “Moon the Loon” from the trail of destroyed drum kits and trashed hotel rooms left in his wake. He was known for his unique drumming style, playing zig-zag across his elaborate drum kit with a wash of cymbals. His playing ushered in an era in which drums became far more than simply a means of keeping the beat. Moon’s unorthodox yet exciting style of drumming can be found on many of The Who’s greatest records, including “I Can See For Miles,” “Young Man Blues,” “Won’t Get Fooled Again” and “Who Are You.” Moon died in 1978 at 32 years old after overdosing on medicine he was taking to combat alcoholism. Moon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a member of The Who.</p>

The album produced a series of hits, including “In Bloom,” “Come As You Are” and “Polly,” and ushered in a new genre of rock called “grunge.” Cobain was hailed as the voice of a dissatisfied generation, but the acclaim proved too much for the young artist. A year after the release of the group’s follow-up album In Utero, the 27-year-old Cobain fatally shot himself.</p>
