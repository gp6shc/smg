			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The work that goes on behind the scenes of a photo shoot or news conference is<strong><em> not</em></strong> for the faint of heart. Pushing one’s creativity to the limit throughout the planning and execution of a high-stakes event is both exhausting and rewarding.</p>
<p>When I’m working all the angles of an event, the devil is always in the details. There’s the lighting, staging, makeup, talent, photography, sound, scripting and the venue, to name just a few. And, if you’re working with children, you may as well forget sticking to a plan because kids will just blow it up &#8212; they don’t care too much about deadlines!</p>
<p>I can’t give away all of the ingredients to the secret sauce of our success, but I will share a few event coordination tips with you…</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> Expect the unexpected &#8212; rain, talent that doesn’t show up, crying children, a competing event that steals your audience.  When planning a big event, always have a Plan B.  A good rule of thumb is to plan for the worst and deliver the best.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong>  Pay attention to the details.  A successful event is the product of a million small details that were planned with precision.   Look at it through your audience’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> Do a site visit and a sound check before the guest speakers, talent or reporters arrive.  It’s important to be able to hear the message, so make sure the ambient noise is manageable. Don’t be afraid to ask for a break at a certain time if there’s lawn mowing or vacuuming going on nearby!</p>
<p><strong>Four:</strong>  Be likeable; don’t get so caught up in what you’re doing that you forget to have fun! Interact positively with the people around you; collaborate closely with your colleagues and be sure to market your victories internally as well as externally.</p>
<p><strong>Last but not least</strong>: Deliver a “WOW” factor.  Mutually agree on goals and metrics you can meet and then exceed expectations.</p>
<p>Our clients are first-rate and they deserve the very best. Check out a few pictures from behind the scenes of some of our most recent work with clients.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I have one son who is &#8220;other&#8221;, another who is &#8220;white&#8221;, and a daughter who is &#8220;Latina.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least that&#8217;s how the schools classify them.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t bother to change this classification because it really doesn&#8217;t matter. On top of that, we actually think it&#8217;s hilarious.</p>
<p>I was always excited when our children were born not only because of the promise and pride they have brought to my life but also to see which genes they received from the diverse background my wife and I brought to the gene pool.</p>
<p>Our family is an incredible mélange of African-American, white, Jewish, English, Canadian, Native Americans and more. Our family tree features redheads, blue-eyed blondes, brown-eyed brunettes and dark-eyed people with &#8220;black&#8221; hair.</p>
<p>As the child of an interracial marriage (and born in the early 1960s when those marriages were illegal in parts of the country) I know what it&#8217;s like to grow up when you don&#8217;t fit neatly into columns and classifications.</p>
<p>I was sitting next to my father enrolling in 7th grade when the school secretary asked my father if I was his natural child. Without raising his voice or showing anger, my father (in a very Clint Eastwood way) said, &#8220;Yes, he is.&#8221; When I was in high school, a fellow teenager asked me, &#8220;Why do you speak all proper and s*%t?&#8221; I have watched people stare at me as they tried to get to the courage to ask me, &#8220;What are you?&#8221; Incidentally, it&#8217;s that same question my children get asked even today.</p>
<p>So, I was shocked but not surprised when some loud and ignorant people on social media had such an ugly reaction to our new Miss America, Nina Davuluri, who happens to be of Indian-American ancestry.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t quote the outrageous comments that flew from some of her fellow Americans in the &#8220;social sphere&#8221; but they were most definitely not social. I&#8217;m proud to say she&#8217;s Miss America. Diversity is something we should embrace &#8212; it is not embarrassing.</p>
<p>The episode echoes the reaction of some when entertainer Marc Anthony sang &#8220;God Bless America&#8221; at Major League Baseball&#8217;s All-Star Game. Anthony was born in New York City to Puerto Rican parents. By the way, Puerto Rico is a U.S. Territory. In spite of this fact, some people were upset that a Latino sang &#8220;God Bless America&#8221; at a baseball game.</p>
<p>The whole episode brings up a question: What does it mean to be American?</p>
<p>Well, I believe there are only a few requirements to be American:</p>
<p>Be born in the U.S., certain territories or outlying possessions of the U.S. and subject to U.S. jurisdiction; be born to parents who were U.S. citizens at the time of your birth; apply for &#8220;derived&#8221; or &#8220;acquired&#8221; citizenship through parents; or apply for naturalization.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Nina Davuluri and Marc Anthony pass the test. They are American.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt the world has changed. We have a president with an African name who is of mixed-race heritage. The president and I have roots in the hills of South Central Kansas. His great grandparents and my grandparents are buried in the same cemetery. We are American, too.</p>
<p>Our country is now more complex than the country that is reflected in that set of little racial check-off boxes that you find on forms.</p>
<p>According to the 2011 data from the U.S. Census, the median age of non-Hispanic Whites living in the U.S. is 38.3. The median age of Hispanics <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/statistics/hispanics-u-s-demographic-snapshot-20120508" target="_hplink">living in the U.S.</a> is 27. The AHAA <a href="http://ahaa.org/default.asp?contentID=161" target="_hplink">says</a> 65 percent of U.S. Hispanics are Millennials &#8212; aged 22 to 35.</p>
<p>America is getting younger and browner. Get used to it.</p>
<p>America looks like my children and me. I believe that&#8217;s a good thing for everyone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saturday marked the fifth year of our annual photo shoot for the <a title="FSU Women’s Basketball" href="http://sachsmedia.com/case-study/fsu-womens-basketball/">Florida State University Women&#8217;s Basketball Team</a>. The Sachs team spent the day photographing the Lady Noles at four different locations to obtain a variety of shots, including outdoor, formal, and water shots (yes, water!). We wanted the shots to be just as dynamic as the girls themselves.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to give a shout out to our photographers Dave Barfield and Josh McLawhorn for the fantastic photographs, the Aveda Institute for providing hair and makeup services for shoot, and CrossFit BlackBox for allowing us to completely soak their gym! We&#8217;ll be posting some of the finished photos later this month.</p>
