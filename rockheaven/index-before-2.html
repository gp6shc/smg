      <h3>Rock &amp; Roll Heaven: How they would look today</h3>
        <p>What might some of the rock 'n' roll era's greatest stars have achieved and what might they look like now, if they had not died before their time? To explore these tantalizing questions, Sachs Media Group partnered with photo restoration and manipulation company <a href="http://phojoe.com" target="_blank"> Phojoe</a> to create this gallery of images. It is a heartfelt tribute to the memory of beloved artists who helped shape generations of music fans, in order to keep their memory alive for future generations.</p>

    <p>Below each image is a brief biography of the music superstar, along with expert insights from two noted musicologists:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Dr. Reebee Garofalo, a professor of Community Media and Technology at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Dr. Garofalo is an internationally known scholar of popular music studies who has written numerous articles on music and politics, racism, censorship and the globalization of the music industry. Among his recent publications is Rockin' Out: Popular Music in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> Elijah Wald, a musician and frequent writer about music, including more than ten years as world music writer for the Boston Globe. In recent years he has written books on such diverse subjects as Delta blues, Mexican drug ballads, hitchhiking and a broad social history of American popular music. He has authored eleven books, including How the Beatles Destroyed Rock ’n’ Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music.</li>

              <h3>Guitarist/songwriter with the breakthrough grunge band Nirvana</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1994  <strong> Age:</strong> 27</h3>
              <p>Kurt Cobain (February 20, 1967 – April 8, 1994) Considered by many to be the greatest rock artist of the 1990s, guitarist/songwriter Cobain led the Seattle-area band Nirvana to the top of the charts with “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” a hard-driving song from the band’s Nevermind album. The album produced a series of hits, including “In Bloom,” “Come As You Are” and “Polly,” and ushered in a new genre of rock called “grunge.” Cobain was hailed as the voice of a dissatisfied generation, but the acclaim proved too much for the young artist. A year after the release of the group’s follow-up album In Utero, the 27-year-old Cobain fatally shot himself.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“Given his aversion to celebrity, had Cobain lived he would likely have continued to work with Nirvana but also explored smaller, less commercial projects with other players, trying to recapture some of the anonymity and artistic freedom of his early years. He would probably have pursued artistic outlets offstage and behind the scenes, eschewing the limelight and using his fame to bring attention to young musicians on the cutting edge, as well as exploring his deep interest in Americana styles by producing and collaborating with older roots artists.”</p>

              <h3>Drummer for the Beach Boys</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1983  <strong> Age:</strong> 39</h3>
              <p>Dennis Wilson (December 4, 1944 – December 28, 1983) Wilson was the drummer for surf music pioneers the Beach Boys, contributing greatly to the California band’s overwhelming success in the music industry. He was part of a true family band, joining brothers Brian and Carl Wilson, cousin Mike Love and good friend Al Jardine to produce upbeat songs that featured catchy guitar hooks, pulsing drum beats and incomparable vocal harmonies. He was assigned lead vocals on a few early songs, but his vocal claim to fame came in 1965 with the song “Do You Wanna Dance.” Dennis’ gruff voice captured the hearts of millions when combined with tender ballads. Dennis struggled with alcohol and drugs, and he died of an accidental drowning in 1983, when he was just 39 years old. Wilson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys in 1988.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“Though his solo projects were personally satisfying, Wilson would have continued to be known principally for his work with the Beach Boys. Aside from touring the world with his bandmates, he would have appeared in all-star shows with fellow rock legends, made occasional albums with musician friends (one can’t help musing about a duet project with long-time friend and lover Christine McVie), and perhaps would have added luster to his brother Brian’s phenomenal comeback.”</p>

              <h3>Singer and drummer for the Carpenters</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1983  <strong> Age:</strong> 32</h3>
              <p>Karen Carpenter (March 2, 1950 – February 4, 1983) Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Carpenter and her brother Richard formed the Carpenters. Together, they made up one of the most successful groups of the early 1970s with hits like “Close to You,” “We’ve Only Just Begun” and “Top of the World.” They were among the biggest-selling acts of the decade with ten million-selling singles, and over the years their combined worldwide sales of albums and singles has exceeded 100 million units. However, Carpenter suffered from self-image problems and after a long battle with anorexia nervosa put undue stress on her heart, she died from cardiac arrest at age 32. </p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“At the time of Karen’s death, the Carpenters were in transition. She had explored solo projects while Richard dealt with some personal issues, but they were back together and cementing their global popularity with international tours. They would likely have continued to build on the foundation of their classic hits, touring and playing top venues, and in the 21st century might well have established their own showcase theater in Las Vegas, placing them in the company of such stars as Prince and Bette Midler.”</p>

              <p>Bob Marley (February 6, 1945 – May 11, 1981) Coming out of Kingston, Jamaica’s Trench Town ghetto, Marley became reggae music’s most influential artist. Marley founded the Wailers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, and the group produced some of the genre’s most recognized songs, including “Get Up, Stand Up” and “I Shot the Sheriff.” After Tosh and Wailer left the group, Marley continued producing such hits as “Exodus,” “One Love” and “Three Little Birds.” Marley was hugely influential in Jamaica in the mid 1970s, described by Time Magazine as rivaling the government as a political force. Marley died of cancer in Miami in 1981 at the age of 36, and was buried in Jamaica with full state honors. Marley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. </p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“Marley’s success was globally inspirational in a way no previous superstar had been. Had he lived, he would undoubtedly have gone beyond his collaborations with Jamaican, American and British musicians, becoming the central figure in the ‘world music’ explosion and forging new fusions with artists from Africa, Latin America and Asia. Given his international stature and his devotion to the varied styles of the African diaspora, he would have been a dream partner for stars like the Fugees and Kanye West. It is also likely he would have also attempted to use his influence beyond the musical domain, challenging the ongoing dominance of the old colonial powers and serving as a spokesman for people of color around the world.”</p>

              <h3>Founder of the Beatles and influential songwriter and pioneer for peace</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1980  <strong> Age:</strong> 40</h3>
              <p>John Lennon (October 9, 1940 – December 8, 1980) Lennon formed half of music’s most successful songwriting partnership, joining with Paul McCartney to compose dozens of Number 1 hits. Lennon founded the Quarrymen in the late 1950s in his hometown of Liverpool, England, eventually joined in the band by McCartney and guitarist George Harrison. Lennon changed the group’s name to the Beatles and, finally joined by drummer Ringo Starr, in 1962 the band began an eight-year run producing an unprecedented string of hit singles and such influential albums as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road. After the band broke up in 1970, Lennon went on to have a successful solo career with hits like “Instant Karma,” “Imagine,” “Mind Games,” “Whatever Gets You Through the Night” and “Woman.” After a five-year break from recording to concentrate on raising his young son, Lennon made a successful return to the music scene in 1980. Shortly after the release of the album Double Fantasy, at the age of 40, Lennon was shot to death as he arrived home from a recording session. Lennon was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994.</p>   
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“Having retired from the music business and devoted himself to fatherhood, Lennon returned with a new maturity and would have been likely to continue his social activism with more focus. He paved the way for such musical activists as Bob Geldof and Bono, but given his talent and fame could have accomplished even greater things. Given what he had done already, it is hard to put limits on what he might have attempted, and it seems safe to assume he would have continued to surprise even his most devoted followers. He might have been the first classic rocker to embrace the hip-hop revolution, composed avant-garde experimental music, gone back to his roots by forming a hard-rocking guitar quartet, or most likely would have experimented with all of those alternatives and more. (And yes, he almost certainly would have stayed with Yoko Ono.)”</p>

              <h3>Notoriously wild drummer for the Who</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1978  <strong> Age:</strong> 32</h3>
              <p>Keith Moon (August 23, 1946 – September 7, 1978) One of the greatest rock and roll drummers ever, Moon earned a reputation as “Moon the Loon” from the trail of destroyed drum kits and trashed hotel rooms left in his wake. He was known for his unique drumming style, playing zigzag across his elaborate drum kit with a wash of cymbals. His playing ushered in an era in which drums became far more than simply a means of keeping the beat. Moon’s unorthodox yet exciting style of drumming can be found on many of the Who’s greatest recordings, including “I Can See For Miles,” “Young Man Blues,” “Won’t Get Fooled Again” and “Who Are You.” Moon died in 1978 at age 32 after overdosing on medicine he was taking to combat alcoholism. Moon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a member of the Who.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“Though he occasionally experimented with side projects, Keith Moon was always first and foremost the heartbeat, clown and spectacular lunatic of the Who, and his career would have continued to be wrapped up with his longtime bandmates. Had he lived, the Who would not have broken up in the 1980s and could have continued on a par with the Rolling Stones, making new albums and selling out stadiums around the world.  The music would not have changed all that much, but new generations of fans would have a chance to see them with the magnificent madman Moon on drums.”</p>

              <h3>The King of Rock and Roll</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1977  <strong> Age:</strong> 42</h3>
              <p>Elvis Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) Universally hailed as the King of Rock and Roll, Presley exploded onto the music scene in the mid 1950s. Presley was a truck driver when he was discovered in 1953 by producer Sam Phillips. He came into Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee, to record a song for his mother, and Philips was struck by Presley’s voice and signed the singer. Inspired by gospel, country and western, and rhythm and blues, Presley and his band (guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black) recorded a number of songs for Sun, including “That’s Alright, Mama” and “Blue Moon of Kentucky.” Presley signed with RCA in 1955 and subsequently released a succession of hit records, including “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Hound Dog,” “Jailhouse Rock” and the title track from his first movie, “Love Me Tender.” Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958; after two years in the service, he returned and focused primarily on making movies and recording soundtracks. Presley starred in 33 movies in his career and returned to making music in 1968 with his famed televised comeback special. That was followed by music he recorded in Memphis, including “Suspicious Minds,” “In the Ghetto” and “Kentucky Rain.” Presley was 42 when he died of a heart attack at Graceland, his Memphis mansion, on August 16, 1977. He continues to hold the record for most Top 40 hits (104), most Top 10 hits (38) and most weeks at Number One (80). Presley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“As long as Colonel Parker remained his manager, Presley would have been unlikely to make any dramatic changes of artistic direction – but it is not hard to imagine the Colonel opening an Elvis Grand Casino in Las Vegas where the ‘King of Rock and Roll’ could have held court throughout the years. After Parker’s death in 1997, Elvis might have branched out. Like his old Sun labelmate Johnny Cash, he might have put himself in the hands of young rock producers and revisited his blues and country roots, making stripped-down albums that would have won him a new following of young hipsters. Given his command of older pop styles, he would also have been an obvious first choice for the Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett superstar duet projects.”</p>

              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1974  <strong> Age:</strong> 33</h3>
              <p>‘Mama’ Cass Elliot (September 19, 1941 – July 29, 1974) Born Ellen Naomi Cohen, the Baltimore native made a name for herself – “Mama” – as the booming-voiced singer with the superstar ‘60s quartet the Mamas and the Papas. From 1965 to 1968, the group recorded a series of top ten hits including “Monday, Monday,” “California Dreaming” and “I Saw Her Again.” The group’s last hit, “Dream A Little Dream of Me,” launched her into a brief but successful solo singing career, as well as acting roles. Mama Cass succumbed to a heart attack in 1974, at age 33. Cass Elliot was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Mamas and the Papas in 1998.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“Unlike most 1960s rockers, Cass was completely at home with cabaret and theater performance styles. At the time of her death she was already appearing in prestigious venues such as the London Palladium, and with her powerful voice might have built an enduring career as a solo concert diva on the order of Bette Midler or Barbra Streisand. As one of the rock world’s great ensemble singers, it seems likely that she would also have continued to work in group settings, perhaps adding her soulful harmony to superstar collaborations like the Linda Ronstadt-Dolly Parton-Emmylou Harris trio.”</p>

              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1973  <strong> Age:</strong> 37</h3>
              <p>Bobby Darin (May 14, 1936 – December 20, 1973) The Bronx-born Darin was an extraordinary entertainer, excelling as a singer, songwriter and actor. Highlights of Darin’s singing career were the hits “Splish Splash,” “Dream Lover” and his signature song, “Mack the Knife,” which spent a full year in the top 10, including 9 weeks at No. 1.  After lengthy health problems, Darin died following open-heart surgery at age 37. Darin was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
”At the time of his death, Darin was increasingly focusing on politics and the ‘turbulent aspects of modern society.’ Having traveled with Bobby Kennedy, he might well have entered the political arena, perhaps returning to New York to challenge the Rockefeller machine. With his commitment to social change, he would undoubtedly have been a mainstay at major events like Live Aid. And with his breadth of taste and talent he might have expanded the range of artists involved in those projects, bringing in friends from the world of Hollywood and Las Vegas. As he grew older, he would probably have concentrated more deeply on his acting career, and might in the end have been better known for his activism and acting than his music.”</p>

              <h1>Jim Morrison</h1>
              <h3>Ethereal “Lizard King” singer and songwriter for the Doors</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1971  <strong> Age:</strong> 27</h3>
              <p>Jim Morrison (December 8, 1943 – July 3, 1971) Morrison, the charismatic lead singer and lyricist for the Doors, joined with keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore to form the Doors. The band exploded onto the national music scene in the mid 1960s with the hit song “Light My Fire” and went on to create some of the most poetic, intense and revolutionary rock 'n' roll music ever produced. At 11 minutes, the band's song, "The End" was one of rock's first long-form pieces and exemplifies the sound of mid-‘60s "acid rock." Backed by Manzarek's calliope style of organ playing, Morrison wrote image-rich lyrics that revolutionized the rock genre. The band ventured across musical styles, with hits ranging from the blues-infused "Roadhouse Blues" to the horn-rich pop of "Touch Me" to the ethereal "Riders on the Storm." Morrison frequently clashed with authority, including memorable incidents in which he was banned from the Ed Sullivan Show after ignoring demands to change certain lyrics and his controversial arrest in Miami for alleged indecent behavior. He died in the bathtub of a Paris apartment at the age of 27 and is buried a short distance away. Morrison was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Doors in 1993.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“Of all the 1960s rockers who died young, Morrison is the most difficult to pin down in terms of where his artistic muse might have taken him, given his broad range of interests not only in music but also in poetry, film and theater. He undoubtedly would have been involved in the explosion of independent filmmaking in the 1970s, and was perhaps the only rock star of his generation who would have been completely at home in the punk rock movement of the 1970s and later alternative scenes. Alternatively, he might have abandoned music entirely, devoted himself to writing, moved to New York, Paris, Tokyo or Dakar, and by now be honored by a few cognoscenti as an experimental avant-gardist rather than revered by millions as a rock star.”</p>

              <h3>Extraordinary rock-blues singer</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1970  <strong> Age:</strong> 27</h3>
              <p>Janis Joplin (January 19, 1943 – October 4, 1970) Janis Joplin was an extraordinary blues singer whose influence on the music industry can still be felt today. Emerging from her East Texas home of Port Arthur, she moved to San Francisco and gained nationwide acclaim as the lead singer for Big Brother and the Holding Company. The band burst on the national scene with its landmark second album Cheap Thrills. Joplin performed solo at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival in 1969 and with the Full Tilt Boogie Band in the spring of 1970. Later that year, the hard-living singer was found dead of a drug overdose at the age of 27. Her final studio album, Pearl, was released posthumously and attained quadruple-platinum status. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“The pace and intensity of Joplin’s lifestyle and singing were unsustainable, and she would almost certainly have experienced a collapse of some kind in the early 1970s. However, by the 1980s she could have returned with the wisdom and depth of that experience, re-emerging like similarly troubled peers such as Joe Cocker and Tina Turner. Her voice would undoubtedly have lost much of its screaming power, but gained control. She could have surrounded herself with the best sidemen available and created music that – while it would have been less raw and wild than her youthful work – would have been surer, deeper and just as passionately soulful.”</p>

              <h3>Widely hailed as rock’s greatest guitarist</h3>
              <h3><strong>Died:</strong> 1970  <strong> Age:</strong> 27</h3>
              <p>Jimi Hendrix (November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) Widely hailed as rock’s greatest electric guitarist, Jimi Hendrix had an impact on the music industry this is still felt today. His first album, Are You Experienced, featured songs that would come to define a generation, including “Purple Haze,” “The Wind Cries Mary” and “Foxey Lady.” The left-handed guitarist built his own recording studio, Electric Lady Studios, in the late 1960s, and closed the legendary Woodstock Music and Art Festival in August 1969. Sadly, Hendrix succumbed to drugs, dying of an overdose in 1971 at the age of 27. Jimi Hendrix was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1992.</p>
              <p><strong>Insights by Dr. Reebee Garofalo and Elijah Wald:</strong>
“At the time of his death, Hendrix had become frustrated with the limitations of rock and was discussing a duet project with Miles Davis. This would have opened up new worlds to both artists, and could have been the defining masterpiece of jazz-rock fusion. He would also undoubtedly have continued his innovative explorations of new sound technologies, and created increasingly complex and ambitious long-form compositions. Though in the process he would have moved further from the hit-focused rock-pop mainstream, he would have provided a bridge between the funk-jazz of Parliament and the growing experimental rock movement, and could now be reigning as the pioneer, father figure and supreme master of the jam-band scene.”</p>
